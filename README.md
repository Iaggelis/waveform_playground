# Waveform Playground
A set of small programs to deal with some nuances of waveforms written in root files

## rootfileConverter
This program converts the waveform saved as a TGraph, as two separate `std::vector`

## waveform2csv
This program converts the waveform from a root files to one or more simple txt files, that are easily read (especially in FORTRAN)

## Requirements
- c++17
- [ROOT](https://root.cern/) (OPTIONAL)
